# Hubspot Assets
Assets for use with the Hubspot marketing tools.

The HTML files can be used directly as template snippets in the Hubspot CMS. 

This particular file has a few content bits in the middle; the important part for making new content is, in particular, the grid. Documentation for the Foundation flex grid is found [here](https://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/flex-grid.html).

The included CSS file has been run through UnCSS for optimization - if something doesn't look right when new content is added, it's probably missing statements, just reach out to your friendly neighborhood web developer.

These assets can be added directly to the Hubspot CMS. The CSS and JS assets at the main website are "hashed" or have unique filenames with each buildâ€”therefore can't be linked to permanently.

`seldon.css` is the original, unoptimized CSS - don't use that except for reference.
